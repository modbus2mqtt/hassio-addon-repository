## About

**Modbus<=> MQTT** (modbus2mqtt) is an interface from Modbus to MQTT and vice versa.
It enables user to easily add Modbus Devices to their MQTT environment.
Additionally it supports Home Assistant MQTT Discovery. As soon as the device is configured in Modbus <=> MQTT, it will immediatly be available in Home Assistant.

It provides an editor that makes it easy to create the mappings from Modbus data to MQTT.
